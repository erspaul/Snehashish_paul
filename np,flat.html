  <h1>Exploring the Flat Areas of Nepal</h1>

  <p>Nepal's flat areas, located in the southern Terai region, offer a contrasting landscape to the mountainous and hilly terrains. The Terai is a vast, fertile plain extending from the foothills of the Himalayas to the border with India, known for its lush greenery and abundant agricultural fields.</p>

  <p>The Terai is characterized by dense jungles, wildlife sanctuaries, and meandering rivers. This region is a habitat for diverse flora and fauna, including endangered species like the one-horned rhinoceros and Bengal tiger. Agriculture plays a major role, with extensive rice paddies and wheat fields contributing to the country's food production.</p>

  <p>Explore national parks, enjoy wildlife safaris, and experience the vibrant festivals celebrated by the local Tharu communities. The flat areas of Nepal provide a different perspective, showcasing the country's biodiversity and the harmonious coexistence of nature and human life.</p>
